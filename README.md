## Overview 

This repository contains replication files and data for [Kunz, Trinh, et al. (2025)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2025.118500); more details can be found in the paper. 

The analysis is based on the [HILDA](https://dataverse.ada.edu.au/dataverse.xhtml?alias=hilda) survey and data, which has restricted access but can be applied for and accessed following the link above. 

Here, we describe and provide our code. We encourage any replication attempt, and interested readers should not hesitate to contact [Johannes Kunz](mailto:johannes.kunz@monash.edu) or [Anh Trinh](mailto:Trong-Anh.Trinh@monash.edu) about any of these. For brevity, we exclude the multitude of replication files for the Appendix version, but are happy to provide these upon request. 

We are in the process of vetting the do files used for data construction, which will be added shortly. For inquiries about these in the meantime, please write to [Johannes Kunz](mailto:johannes.kunz@monash.edu). 

## Replication do-files 

Here, we collect the do-file used in our analysis. We do not repost the datasets as they are proprietary, which requires approved access (see above). The dofiles of all main results should be replicable once data access has been granted. Please let us know if you encounter any issues. 

The replication files are ordered as the exhibits appear in the paper.
